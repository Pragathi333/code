                <h2>COVID-19 poses novel challenges for global primary care</h2>
                <p>Published on <span class="date">21/07/2019</span></p>
                <p>There has never been more interest in breathlessness: 
                    how it feels, how to diagnose it, how to treat it, and how to assess and support recovery. 
                    This presents opportunities for the primary care respiratory community to influence and encourage research priorities, 
                    and highlights the need to share knowledge through scholarly publication. For example, the breathlessness algorithm and its development process by the Primary Care Respiratory Society and the British Thoracic Society was not widely followed, 
                    because breathlessness did not fit the silo-planning of many health services. Instead, it was built on clinical experience and knowledge categorised by symptom not disease (www.respiratoryfutures.org.uk/resources/impress-documents/impress-breathlessness-algorithm/). 
                    Now, with COVID-19, there is a new urgency. We have seen examples of assessment algorithms1 recommending new tools that almost immediately are rejected as unworkable, such as the Roth test (www.cebm.net/). 
                    We encourage primary care respiratory-interested clinicians and academics to seize the moment to propose, test and publish tools to assess breathlessness in a primary care consultation and also online where usual questions may no longer be helpful.

                <h2>Asthma control and COPD symptom burden in patients using fixed-dose combination inhalers (SPRINT study)</h2>
                <p>Published on <span class="date">15/06/2021</span></p>
                <p>Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are of significant concern worldwide owing to their high prevalence and substantial clinical and economic burden.
                    While asthma is the most prevalent respiratory disease in the world (and twice as common as COPD),
                    the mortality rate associated with COPD is eight times higher than for asthma.
                    The absolute number of patients with these two conditions is increasing as the global population grows.
                    Inhaled medications are the mainstay of treatment for both COPD and asthma,2,3 but many patients with asthma and COPD have poor treatment adherence and/or inhaler technique.
                    Improvements in these patient factors have the potential to substantially increase the effectiveness of therapy and help alleviate disease burden.
                    Combined inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting beta agonist (LABA) treatments play a central role in the management of persistent asthma 
                    and have been associated with beneficial effects on lung function, exacerbation rates, and patient-reported outcomes compared with each treatment alone in patients with COPD.10,11,12 Several inhalers containing a fixed-dose combination (FDC) and ICS and LABA are commercially available in Europe for the delivery of maintenance therapies for COPD and/or asthma. The convenience of having both substances in a single inhaler may help improve treatment adherence and is often cost saving, 
                    compared with using two separate inhalers.13 In April 2014, marketing authorisation was granted for DuoResp® Spiromax®, a budesonide/formoterol combination treatment alternative to the existing Symbicort Turbuhaler, which contains the same active substances but uses a different dry powder inhaler (DPI) mechanism with fewer preparation manoeuvres.</p>
